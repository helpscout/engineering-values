# Engineering Leadership - Success Measures and Guiding Principles

At the heart of the role, a Coach at Help Scout is accountable for 2 things:

- empowering your team to deliver a steady flow of high quality customer value (i.e. mission aligned results), and;
- enabling the short and long term success of the engineers on your team.

How you do this is layered and nuanced, and hopefully part of what motivates you to be a leader and coach. Working closely with product managers and product designers, you will ensure that your team has the proper knowledge, staffing, and skills to be successful and do the best work of their career.
