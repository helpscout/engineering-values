# Help Scout Engineering Leadership Team Values

In addition to our commitment to building and encouraging a [1st team mindset](https://www.attack-gecko.net/2018/06/25/building-a-first-team-mindset/) in engineering leadership, we strive to embody these values as we work together.

- We are open, supportive, and kind, making it easy to dig into hard things, challenge each other, and push each other toward fulfillment and growth
- We put things in front of the team for help and thought-share to learn from each other and inspire each other
- We are thoughtful, thinking about each other, making sure we feel like someone has our backs, and always considering how what we do will impact others
- We are high-performing and together we have a multiplier effect, where we can do more collaborating together as a fellowship with a deep sense of purpose
- We are optimistic about what our team members can do but realistic about the challenges of building a healthy and productive engineering team
- We provide clarity and have a proactive approach for our teams, of course, and also for each other
- We slow each other down to be sure everything we do is considerate of anyone directly impacted and the larger team
